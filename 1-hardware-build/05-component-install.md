## 1.5 Component Installation

In this sequence, I will go through all the steps I went through while installing the hardware components while building my own node.

> Before you start building, ground yourself. Grounding can be done, for example, by reaching for the heater.

I've split the process into multiple sections to make navigation all pictures easier. We will go over how to install memory, storage, antennas, hard disks.

### 1.5.1 Attaching the Components

Unpack the memory bars.

Click them one on top of the other into the holder provided.

If you want to optionally pre-equip for WiFi as mentioned above, now is the time. Get the connection cables.

press one at a time into the edge provided in front of it. be careful and make sure they are seated properly, as they tend to pop out.

In the next step, the hard disk is inserted above the antenna connection.

Click it in diagonally from above and screw it tight at the rear end.

### 1.5.2 Adding Aditional Storage

If you have another large hard drive that connects with a hard drive label, get the appropriate frame that is included in the package and mount the 2.5" hard drive onto it. The frame is then screwed into the housing.

In the next step, connect the hard drive to the center of the mainboard using the related cable that came with the NUC's package.

> There is only one hard drive connector on the mainboard.

After attaching the cable, screw the frame to the top of the case so that the hard drive is facing down. It will sit right under the edge of the case, leaving enough room for attaching the backplage.

### 1.5.3 Attaching the Backplate

Hold the motherboard against the back of the case and check if it fits properly. If you have antenna connectors, screw them to the back panel.

![Attaching the Backplate 1](/img/build_29.png)

Make sure the panel is seated directly with the motherboard connectors and nothing is pressed down on the inside. If it is, the motherboard must be slightly readjusted again, as the fittings have a millimeter of clearance.

When everything fits correctly, screw in the back panel of the motherboard.

### 1.5.4 Adding the Storage Cooler

The next step is to install the hard disk cooler.

![Adding the Storage Cooler 1](/img/build_32.png)

Remove the protective foil and place the heat-conducting rubber mass on the hard disk.

> The sticker of the hard disk does not need to be removed, as it is made of thermally conductive film and adhesive. If you remove it, you will lose your warranty.

![Adding the Storage Cooler 2](/img/build_33.png)

Clean the metal piece with an alcohol wipe and reapply thermal paste to the strip that will be directly connected to the housing. Also, try to clean the inner housing part where the cooler will be placed with a cotton swap and alcohol.

![Adding the Storage Cooler 3](/img/build_34.png)

Insert the cooler slowly from the top without smearing heat-conducting paste. Be careful, because the rubber mass sticks and it is difficult to move once it sticks.

### 1.5.5 Assambling the Enclosure

Screw on the last side of the housing without bending the cable.

> If you have a second hard drive, make sure the frame sits evenly without touching the lid.

![Assambling the Enclosure 1](/img/build_36.png)

Depending on whether you want to place the case upright or lying down, you can now install covers and stands.

![Assambling the Enclosure 2](/img/build_37.png)

I decided to use the upright placement because it saves me space to the sides in my server shelf.

> If you have a professional server rack, the horizontal position is probably more suitable, since you can add more levels and switch frames above and below.

![Assambling the Enclosure 3](/img/build_38.png)

This is how the finished node looks when the antennas are also attached. however, these are not used in regular server use, as there should always be a wired internet connection.

So you can leave them unscrewed and keep them until you decide to transform your node into a home server or desktop device some day.

![Assambling the Enclosure 4](/img/build_39.png)

If you got everything from router, connection, and the node itself, we can start with configuring the BIOS and installing the operating system.
