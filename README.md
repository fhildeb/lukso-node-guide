# lukso-node-guide

This repository contains all the necessary information to build, set up, and run a node for EVM Proof-of-Stake blockchains, such as [LUKSO](https://docs.lukso.tech/). It is the essence of running a node at home and should act as a Wiki if you need detailed information about any possible step.

- üìñ **More than 80 Pages of Theory and Best Practice**
- üåç **Compiled from a dozen Guides, Forums, and Wikis**
- üöÄ **Beginner-Friendly Step-by-Step Documentation**
- üìù **Plug-and-Play Grafana Dashboards**

```

## Enable Caching

1. Open the [`docusaurus.config.ts`](/docusaurus.config.ts) file
2. Comment out the `customWebpackPlugin` setup

```ts
// function customWebpackPlugin() {
//       return {
//         name: "custom-webpack-plugin",
//         configureWebpack() {
//           return {
//             cache: false,
//           };
//         },
//       };
//     },
```
