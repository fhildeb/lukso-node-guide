# lukso-node-guide

**INFO: THIS REPO IS CURRENTLY UNDER MAINTENANCE TO BECOME A DOCUMENTATION WEBPAGE FOR ALL SUPPORTED BLOCKCHAIN CLIENTS.**

This repository features all information needed to build, set up, and run a node for EVM Proof-of-Stake blockchains such as [LUKSO](https://docs.lukso.tech/). It is the essence of running a node at home and should act as a Wiki if you need detailed information about any possible step.

> _It's a documentation of every single step I went through and explains every desicion I had to cut during the process._

- üìñ **More than 80 Pages of Theory and Best Practice**
- üåç **Compiled from a dozen Guides, Forums, and Wikis**
- üöÄ **Beginner-Friendly Step-by-Step Documentation**

The repository includes a pictured guide of the node build and components, the proper BIOS and operation system setup, installation of the blockchain clients, the configuration of staking and monitoring software, and even includes lagacy guides for the outdated L16 network of LUKSO.

## CLI Support

- Legacy Software: `LUKSO CLI v 0.1.0 - 0.4.4`
- Full Node Setup: `LUKSO CLI v 0.5.0 +`
- Service Automation: `LUKSO CLI v 0.6.1 +`
