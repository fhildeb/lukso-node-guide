# Blockchain Timeline

Only validators that deposited LYXe to the [Genesis Deposit Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x42000421dd80D1e90E56E87e6eE18D7770b9F8cC#code) before it was frozen on May 9th, 2023 can run the back structure of the network until the LYXe Migration is live on the LUKSO blockchain. The migration is [expected](https://medium.com/lukso/its-happening-the-genesis-validators-are-coming-ce5e07935df6) around one month after the initial network start.
