# Staking

## Deposit Theory

There are a few theoretical things to understand about making deposits and putting your stake at risk. Most of these facts will be LUKSO-specific.

### LUKSO Testnet

The testnet exists parallel to the mainnet with all updates and features.

Only whitelisted addresses can become validators, as it is mainly there to test smart contracts and forks.

Many temporary or changing validators could lead to a significant number of unstable validators and slashes in the long run, which might compromise the integrity of the network. Testnet validators are core members and organizations wanting to run and maintain their LUKSO Testnet node in a stable environment over a long period, as they assure healthy uptimes, stability, and quick response times from clients as demand from developers rises.

### Becoming a Validator

Testnet validators need to be whitelisted as they are seen as core members and organizations wanting to run and maintain their LUKSO Testnet node in a stable environment over a long period to ensure healthy uptimes, stability, and quick response times from clients as demand from developers rises.

If you want to become a whitelisted validator on our testnet, prepare your validator keys, set up your node environment, and contact `testnet-validators@lukso.network`. You must send your Ethereum address and more details about your setup and involvement in the developer/network community. If you get whitelisted, you will also get a certain amount of LYXt to deposit your keys.

Visit the official [Testnet Deposit Launchpad](https://deposit.testnet.lukso.network/) and cautiously go through the process of generating keys and depositing stakes to them, in case you have not already.
