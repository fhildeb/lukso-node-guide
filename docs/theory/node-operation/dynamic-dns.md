# Dynamic DNS

In order for the node to be accessible to other participants in a peer-to-peer blockchain, it must have an identifiable and stable IP address. Most internet service providers assign dynamically changing IP addresses to residential customers, and these can change on a weekly basis or router reboots.

The frequent IP address changes disrupt incoming peer connections and slow down the node's visibility and synchronization times. Dynamic DNS solves the problem through linking the dynamic IP address to a permanent domain name, allowing others to find you even when the IP changes.

:::info Default Setup

The üëæ [LUKSO CLI](/docs/guides/client-setup/lukso-cli-installation.md) will optionally set the current interchangeble IP address during the client installation.

## DNS Records

A Domain Name System record can be thought of as the internet's directory and is used to associate a human-readable domain name with an IP address used by computers to communicate. DNS records are of particular importance for the following reasons:

- Allow devices to find each other over the internet without hardcoding IPs
- Enable services like HTTPS, email delivery, and node routing
- Abstract IPs behind stable webpage or service names

## Dynamic DNS

A Dynamic DNS service allows for automatic domain name registration and update in case of an IP address change. Once the IP address changes, the node or the router can trigger the respective DDNS provider to update the DNS record accordingly. Other nodes can thereby continue to be in touch using the domain name without interruption. This is especially useful for:

- Devices that must maintain consistent connectivity
- Services that want to stay discoverable during updates

## DDNS Setups

There are several ways to implement Dynamic DNS. Each varies in technical complexity, flexibility, and setup cost.

For little money, the domain ownership can even be extended without further maintenance. <br /> <br /> **‚Üí** [Dynamic DNS](/docs/guides/modifications/dynamic-dns.md), [üö´ No-IP](https://www.noip.com/), [üê§ Duck-DNS](https://www.duckdns.org/) |
