# Monitoring Tools

Monitoring tools help node operators monitor hardware health, service availability, connection reliability, and validator performance. Whether someone is running a home setup or cloud nodes, real-time observability is essential to avoid downtime, correct bottlenecks, and respond quickly to any type of anomaly.

Monitoring tools typically get connected to [alert systems](/docs/guides/alert-systems/telegram-bot.md) for receiving status updates and warnings via message or email.

## Software List

Local node monitoring tracks the hardware condition and performance of a node. Commonly measured parameters usually include CPU load, memory pressure level, disk utilization, consensus and execution metrics, validator uptimes and syncing health. Having everything measured in real time, the software enables preemptive debugging and extended stability.

| **Prometheus** | Prometheus is an open source system and service monitor and alert tool. It gathers statistics from exporters based on periodic time intervals and provides historical data storage. The service works based on custom rules and alert configurations to proactively detect and diagnose anomalies within the node's infrastructure. |
| **Grafana**    | Grafana is a data visualisation system that converts Prometheus metrics into insightful dashboards. The service supports querying, visualising, alerting, and monitoring data over time. At local node configuration level, it is generally utilized as primary interface to monitor node health and blockchain-specific telemetry. |

## Exporter Services

In a Prometheus environment, internal as well as external metrics get exposed as local HTTP targets that get scraped and saved through exporter services. Depending on their purpose for use, they become system-level or application-level services.

:::info Categories

- **Machine-Centric Exporters**: Monitor system resources from the host's operation system or hardware.
- **Application-Centric Exporters**: Monitor specific services, blochain clients, or fetch external APIs.

| <nobr> **Node Exporter** </nobr>     | Monitors hardware and statistics from the operation system such as CPU utilization, memory load, disk utilization growth, and network throughput. Running it on each node outlines a full picture of the system's health and prevents potential performance degradation.                                                   |
| <nobr> **JSON Exporter** </nobr>     | Periodically fetches data from JSON APIs. This type of exporter is generally used to fetch current prices of the staked coin to synchronize validator activity with market data. For LUKSO homestakers, the LYX price is fetchable using the [ðŸ¦Ž CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) API.                               |
| <nobr> **Blackbox Exporter** </nobr> | Frequently sends data requests to an stable external server, like the [ðŸ“¡ Google DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns?hl=en), to ensure connectivity and low latency. The exporter is used to determine potential connection issues or clarify if downtime comes from the home network or external parties. |

Optional exporters can be configured for various metrics and a more comprehensive dashboards.
