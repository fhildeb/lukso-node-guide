# Utility Tools

Proficiently running a node requires an in-depth knowledge of the command line. From updating packages, editing configuration files, and running system services, having basic tool familiarity will save time and reduce the chances of misconfiguration.

## Text Editors

Text editors allow editing configuration files, service configurations, and application setting tweaking directly from the command line. Ubuntu comes with Vim installed as its default editor, while Nano provides an easier option.

## Package Management

The Advanced Package Tool is the default package manager used in Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu. It is used for the installation, update, and maintenance of software packages downloaded from online repositories.

## System Control

A system daemon service forms a critical part of modern Debian-based operating systems, as it starts and manages the running programs in the background. System control commands allow the user to monitor and manage such programs individually.

## Service Logging

When configuring your service file output, you can choose between journal and system logging, two variants that are very common for reading data and the status of services during maintenance or if there are hickups on ports or interfaces.

| Feature          | Journal Logging                                 | System Logging                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Format           | Human Friendly, Structured Format with Metadata | Basic Output as Plain Text               |
| Filtering        | Powerful Filtering by Unit, Process ID, Time    | Less Advanced Filtering through _grep_   |
| Remote Logging   | Not built-in                                    | Supports remote logging over UDP and TCP |
| Space Efficiency | More Compact using Binary Format                | Larger due to Plain Text Format          |
| Tooling          | Requires _journalctl_ from Ubuntu or Linux      | Compatible across all UNIX tools         |
