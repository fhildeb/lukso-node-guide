# Router Requirements

The router is the first, and often weakest, part in the chain of data exchange for blockchain nodes. Inadequate routers will drop packets, choke under high peer counts, or crash entirely, stalling your sync and putting validators at risk.

:::warning ISP Router Issues

The allâ€‘inâ€‘one routers many internet service provider supply are tuned for casual home use, **not for highâ€‘connection workload** of a blockchain node. Even with correct portâ€‘forwarding, they will likely suffer heavy packet loss, drastic bandwidth drops, or complete lockâ€‘ups of your home network's internet when peer traffic surges. Upgrading to a business or prosumer router usually eliminates these issues.

| Capability                                   | Why it matters                                                                                   | What to look for                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <nobr>**Throughput & Stability** </nobr>     | Sustained, symmetric bandwidth keeps dozens of peer connections flowing without stalls.          | Routing throughput of 1 Gigabit per second with stability forâ€¯10k concurrent sessions. |
| <nobr>**Quality of Service** </nobr>         | Lets you prioritise node traffic over bulk downloads or streaming, avoiding missed attestations. | Priority rules for devices and ports plus DiffServ and CoS support.                    |
| <nobr>**Port Forwarding & Firewall** </nobr> | Nodes must expose TCP or UDP listener ports and validators need inbound traffic.                 | Simple access to map ports and create stateful rules.                                  |
| <nobr>**Gigabit Ethernet** </nobr>           | Wired LAN removes Wiâ€‘Fi bottlenecks and fibre SFP slots will allow futureâ€‘proof upgrades.        | RJâ€‘45 ports with more than 1 Gigabit throughput and optional fibre SFP slots.          |
| <nobr>**IPv6** </nobr>                       | Many peers advertise only v6 addresses. Dualâ€‘stack ensures full reachability.                    | Native dualâ€‘stack with dynamicâ€‘prefix delegation.                                      |
| <nobr>**VPN Server & Client** </nobr>        | Lets you secure RPC or monitoring ports, or tunnel through restrictive ISPs.                     | WireGuard or OpenVPN clients builtâ€‘in or ready to install via firmware.                |
| <nobr>**Dynamic DNS** </nobr>                | Publishes a stable hostname even when your IP changes, so peers & remote tools can reconnect.    | Builtâ€‘in DDNS client that supports multiple providers or custom webhooks.              |
| <nobr>**Regular Firmware Updates** </nobr>   | Patch vulnerabilities and add protocol support                                                   | Vendor that publishes quarterly updates and offers longâ€‘term firmware availability.    |

:::note Example Hardware

For central europe, [**ðŸ§­ AVM**](https://fritz.com/) ranks high for build quality, intuitive UI, long warranty, and frequent updates. Their higherâ€‘end models add fibre and Wiâ€‘FiÂ mesh support for greater connectivity, and even offer an integrated [Dynamic DNS](/docs/theory/node-operation/dynamic-dns.md) service.

Within the [router setup](/docs/guides/router-setup/static-ip-assignment), all configurations were done on a **Fritz!BoxÂ 7590Â AX**.
