# 7.4 Public IP Setup

To ensure your node is discoverable and can establish a healthy number of peer connections, you may need to manually set or update your nodeâ€™s public IP address. This is particularly important for validators, where lower peer counts are an obsticle for accurate block proposals and attestations.

:::tip

Further details about connectivity can be found on the [**Peer Networks**](/docs/theory/blockchain-knowledge/peer-networks.md) and [**Peer Connectivity**](/docs/theory/node-operation/peer-discovery.md) pages of the ðŸ§  [**Theory**](/docs/theory/preparations/node-specifications.md) section.

:::

## 1. Check Peer Connections

Every node operates two independent peer-to-peer networks: the execution and the consensus layer. Each of these networks handles communication with other nodes differently and maintains separate sets of peers. Monitoring both layers is essential to ensure healthy connectivity and network participation.

<Tabs groupId="network-type">
<TabItem value="execution" label="Execution Peers" default>

The execution endpoint allows to fetch the peer counts and lots of [other client-specific intormation](/docs/guides/maintenance/problem-scanning.md#attach-execution-clients).

:::info JSON RPC

JSON-RPC is a lightweight communication protocol encoded in JSON, allowing calls to be sent to a service or server. Each execution client exposes a related interface at port `8545` to retreive calls to interact with the Ethereum network though the local node.

:::

:::tip

By default, the [LUKSO Network Configuration](https://github.com/lukso-network/network-configs) allows to retrieve network data for all execution clients.

:::

**1.1 Install Querying Tool**: _Install the JSON query service for data processing from the RPC endpoint._

```sh
sudo apt install jq
```

**1.2 Call Execution Endpoint**: _While the node is running, call the JSON RPC of the execution client._

```sh
# Retrieve Execution Peers
curl -s -X POST -H "content-type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"net_peerCount","params":[],"id":1}' \
  http://localhost:8545 | jq -r '.result' | xargs printf '%d\n'
```

| <nobr> `xargs printf '%d\n'` </nobr>                                      | Converts the hexadecimal result to a human-readable decimal `%d` number.                                                                            |

The output should be something in the range from 5 to 50 peers.

:::warning

If the command couldn't be executed, have a look at the [**Problem Scanning**](/docs/guides/maintenance/problem-scanning.md) page to learn how to [attach execution clients](/docs/guides/maintenance/problem-scanning.md#attach-execution-clients).

:::

</TabItem> <TabItem value="consensus" label="Consensus Peers">

The consensus endpoint allows to fetch the peer counts and lots of [other client-specific intormation](/docs/guides/maintenance/problem-scanning.md#fetch-consensus-api).

:::info REST API

A REST API is a web-based interface for querying structured data. Ethereum consensus clients expose their status and internal metrics on various ports like `3500`, `5051`, or `5052`, to allow users to access information such as synchronization progress, network stability, node metadata, or the current chain head.

:::

:::tip

By default, the [LUKSO Network Configuration](https://github.com/lukso-network/network-configs) opens the REST API ports for all consensus clients.

:::

**1.1 Install Querying Tool**: _Install the JSON query service for data processing from the REST API endpoint._

```sh
sudo apt install jq
```

**1.2 Call Endpoints**: _While the node is running, call the REST endpoint of the consensus client._

## 2. Stop Node Operation

Depending on your setup method, there are different ways to stop your node before configuring the IP or raising the peer limits.

<Tabs groupId="setup">
  <TabItem value="cli" label="LUKSO CLI" default>

```sh
cd <lukso-working-directory>
lukso stop
```

:::info

Exchange `<lukso-working-directory>` with the path of the node folder.

:::

</TabItem> <TabItem value="automation" label="Service Automation">

```sh
sudo systemctl stop lukso-validator
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 3. Node IP Setup

Once you retrieve your current public IP, you can configure your clients to advertise this IP address.

:::info IP Addresses

Internet Protocol addresses are logical, softwareâ€‘assigned identifiers. IP addresses let routers move data packages between different networks, whether your local home network or across the Internet. The public IP address is how device and nodes communicate with each other to exchange data.

:::

:::tip IP Changes

There are two types of public IP addresses: dynamic and static ones. An active IP address changes over time, while a static IP address remains constant. Most residential users are assigned a dynamic IP address, which can change whenever the internet service provider sees fit. Some ISPs may change the IP address every time the router is rebooted, while others change it at intervals, like once a week. If you want to further set a permanent connection, you can follow the [**Dynamic DNS**](/docs/guides/modifications/dynamic-dns.md) guide.

:::

:::note

The [LUKSO CLI](/docs/guides/client-setup/lukso-cli-installation.md) allows to set the current IP during installation, but need to be updated on a regular basis.

:::

We can use a simple IP echo service to retrieve the node's current IP address and write it to an editor or notepad.

```sh
curl -s https://ipecho.net/plain
```

Depending on your consensus client, this public IP can be set with different properties.

</Tabs>

:::info

Exchange `<your-current-ip-address>` with the public IP address of your node.

:::

:::warning

Ensure there are no missing spaces, characters or unintended linebreaks before saving the configuration file.

:::

## 5. Restart the Node

Depending on your setup method, there are different ways to start your node after the IP address or peer limits have changed.

<Tabs groupId="setup">
  <TabItem value="clinode" label="LUKSO CLI Node" default>

```sh
cd <lukso-working-directory>
lukso start --checkpoint-sync
```

:::info

Exchange `<lukso-working-directory>` with the path of the node folder.

:::

</TabItem> <TabItem value="clivalidator" label="LUKSO CLI Validator" default>

```sh
cd <lukso-working-directory>
lukso start --validator --transaction-fee-recipient "<your-fee-recipient-address>" --checkpoint-sync
```

:::info

The following properties need to be exchanged:

- `<lukso-working-directory>` with the path of the node folder
- `<your-fee-recipient-address>` with the wallet address receiving staking profits

:::

</TabItem> <TabItem value="automation" label="Service Automation">

```sh
sudo systemctl start lukso-validator
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After the clients were started, verify that their services are still up.

```sh
sudo lukso status
```

:::tip

You should always have more than 15 peers after a setup time of 4 to 6 hours. If your peer count is not improving, it indicates a misconfiguration. Check that all mandatory client ports allow data throughput as described within the [Firewall Settings](/docs/guides/client-setup/firewall-settings.md).
