# 5.3 Authentication

In this section, you will lock down SSH on the node to accept only keyâ€‘based logins. We will adjust the config file, test that password logins are disabled, and update your personal computer's configuration file to include your private key for automated authentication.

:::info

The following steps are performed on your ðŸ“Ÿ **node server**.

:::

## 1. Enable Secure Authentication

**1.1 Open the Configuration File**: _Open the SSH daemon's file with your preferred text editor._

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="vim" label="Vim" default>

```sh
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nano" label="Nano">

```sh
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**1.2 Locate the Settings**: _Search for specific setting entries that are inactive by default._

```text
#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
...
#PubkeyAuthentication yes
...
#AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys ./ssh/authored_keys2
...
#PasswordAuthentication yes
#PermitEmptyPasswords no
...
#KbdInteractiveAuthentication no
```

:::warning

Dots indicate that there are further setting properties between these lines that remain untouched.

| **Directive**                | **Description**                                          | **Value**            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| PermitRootLogin              | Allows root login by publicâ€‘key only, not by password.   | prohibit-password    |
| PubkeyAuthentication         | Enables authentication with authorized public keys.      | yes                  |
| AuthorizedKeysFile           | Specifies the single file to read for valid public keys. | .ssh/authorized_keys |
| PasswordAuthentication       | Disables login with a password entirely.                 | no                   |
| PermitEmptyPasswords         | Ensures accounts with blank passwords cannot log in.     | no                   |
| KbdInteractiveAuthentication | Disables challengeâ€“response authentication methods.      | no                   |

</details>

**1.3 Update the Settings**: _Uncomment the entries and change their values._

- Remove any leading _#_ to uncomment each line.
- Set _PasswordAuthentication_ no.
- Ensure only the first _AuthorizedKeysFile_ entry remains.

**1.4 Verify the Changes**: _Check for spelling mistakes or unneeded spaces._

```text
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
...
PubkeyAuthentication yes
...
AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys
...
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitEmptyPasswords no
...
KbdInteractiveAuthentication no
```

**1.5 Save and Exit**: _Apply changes and close the file._

**1.6 Test the new Configuration File**: _Validate your file changes using the SSH daemon._

:::danger

Testing is crucial as you cannot use the regular password login after applying the changes on the main service.

:::

```sh
sudo sshd -t
```

:::info

A blank output indicates no syntax errors.

:::

**1.7 Restart the Service**: _Restart the running SSH daemon for the new adjustments to take effect._

```sh
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

**1.8 Log Out of the Node**: _Exit the node's terminal and SSH session._

```sh
exit
```

## 2. Testing Password Login

:::info

The following steps are performed on your ðŸ’» **personal computer**.

:::

Attempt to SSH with your user password to confirm it is now disabled:

```sh
ssh <ssh-device-alias>
```

:::info

Exchange `<ssh-device-alias` with your actual SSH device name of the node.

:::

You should see:

```sh
ssh: connect to host <ssh-device-alias> port 22: Connection refused
```

:::warning

If you can still log in with a password, verify your configuration file again.

:::

## 3. Update SSH Login Key

To connect to your node again, we need to add the previously generated SSH key to the SSH client.

**3.1 Open the Configuration File**: _Open the SSH client's file with your preferred text editor._

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="vim" label="Vim" default>

```sh
vim ~/.ssh/config
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nano" label="Nano">

```sh
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**3.2 Add the Identity Reference**: _Under the host block of your node, add your private key._

```text
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<chosen-keyname>
```

:::info

Ensure that your `IdentityFile` points to your private `<chosen-keyname>` without the `.pub` extension behind its name.

:::

The final host block should look like this:

```text
Host <ssh-device-alias>
  User <node-username>
  HostName <node-ip>
  Port <ssh-port>
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<chosen-keyname>
```

:::info

- `<ssh-device-alias>`: your nodes SSH device name
- `<node-username>`: your node's username
- `<node-ip-address>`: your node's static IP address
- `<ssh-port>`: your opened port number
- `<chosen-keyname>`: your SSH key

:::

**3.3 Save and Exit**: _Apply changes and close the file._

## 4. Testing Key Login

Now connect using your SSH alias:

```sh
ssh <ssh-device-alias>
```

After entering the correct passphrase, you will end up on the Ubuntu server welcoming printout.

:::info

Instead, of the password promt, the SSH client should ask to encrypt the private key with the passphrase.

:::

:::tip

If you did not set up any password for the key, you will connect automatically.
