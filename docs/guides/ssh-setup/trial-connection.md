# 5.3 Trial Connection

## 5.3 Test the SSH Connection

Verify the configuration by connecting the node machine. Therefore, immediately call the `SSH` application and type your preferred SSH device alias.

```sh
ssh <ssh-device-alias>
```

You should now be able to log into your system by typing in your password. Afterward, you will be greeted by the node's welcoming printout:
