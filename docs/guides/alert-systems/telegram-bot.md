# 9.1 Telegram Bot

Once the [Grafana Dashboard](/docs/guides/monitoring/dashboard-configuration.md) is configured, your node can send alerts through various channels, such as Discord, Telegram, or Email. The alert system can be used to notify you during unregular behavior from metrics, or when certain services cant be reached anymore.
