# 8.2 Port Configuration

Dashboard and monitoring tools like Grafana and Prometheus require open access to be viewed from your personal computer or trough a VPN connecting to your node. This section outlines which ports are used, which need to be open, and what additional ports are used internally during further service configurations.

:::info

Similar to [checking peers](/docs/guides/modifications/peer-count-limits.md#1-check-peer-connections) or [attaching clients](/docs/guides/maintenance/problem-scanning.md#attach-execution-clients), Prometheus can listen to consensus client ports to collect status messages.

:::

## Monitoring Ports

Consensus blockchain clients have default monitoring ports that allow Prometheus to gather metrics.

| PORT | CLIENT                         | DESCRIPTION                      | TCP | External |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | --- | -------- |
| 3500 | [Prysm] ‚Üó                      | Consensus and Validator REST API | ‚úîÔ∏è  | ‚ùå       |
| 5051 | [Teku] ‚Üó                       | Consensus and Validator REST API | ‚úîÔ∏è  | ‚ùå       |
| 5052 | [Nimbus-Eth2] ‚Üó                | Consensus and Validator REST API | ‚úîÔ∏è  | ‚ùå       |
| 5054 | [Lighthouse] ‚Üó                 | Consensus Metrics                | ‚úîÔ∏è  | ‚ùå       |
| 5064 | [Lighthouse] ‚Üó                 | Validator Metrics                | ‚úîÔ∏è  | ‚ùå       |
| 8008 | [Teku] ‚Üó <br/> [Nimbus-Eth2] ‚Üó | Consensus and Validator Metrics  | ‚úîÔ∏è  | ‚ùå       |
| 8080 | [Prysm] ‚Üó                      | Consensus Metrics                | ‚úîÔ∏è  | ‚ùå       |
| 8081 | [Prysm] ‚Üó                      | Validator Metrics                | ‚úîÔ∏è  | ‚ùå       |

Service ports also come with default ports to bundle and present data.

| PORT | SERVICE               | DESCRIPTION          | TCP | External |
| ---- | --------------------- | -------------------- | --- | -------- |
| 3000 | [Grafana] ‚Üó           | Monitoring Dashboard | ‚úîÔ∏è  | ‚úÖ       |
| 7979 | [JSON-Exporter] ‚Üó     | Income Metrics       | ‚úîÔ∏è  | ‚ùå       |
| 9090 | [Prometheus] ‚Üó        | Data Analytics       | ‚úîÔ∏è  | ‚úÖ       |
| 9100 | [Node-Exporter] ‚Üó     | Hardware Metrics     | ‚úîÔ∏è  | ‚ùå       |
| 9115 | [Blackbox-Exporter] ‚Üó | Connectivity Metrics | ‚úîÔ∏è  | ‚ùå       |

:::tip

Node clients and exporter services are for internal use. All their data is collected by Prometheus, that further sends it to Grafana to create visual graphs to the metrics.

:::

:::info

Client port numbers must be defined when creating the [**Prometheus**](/docs/guides/monitoring/prometheus.md) configuration file.

:::

## Firewall Configuration

You can add the Grafana and Prometheus port rules to your firewall as previously done in the [Client Setup](/docs/guides/client-setup/firewall-settings.md).

:::info

The following step is performed on your üíª **personal computer**.

:::

**1. Node Connection**: _Log in to your node if you are not already connected._

```sh
ssh <ssh-device-alias>
```

:::info

The following steps are performed on your üìü **node server**.

:::

**2. Add Port Rules**: _Allow the TCP ports from both Grafana and Prometheus to allow data access._

```sh
sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp
sudo ufw allow 9090/tcp
```

The output of each command should always show:

```sh
Rule added
Rule added (v6)
```

**3. Check Configuration**: _Verify the new firewall rules._

```sh
sudo ufw status
```

The output should look similar to this:

:::info

The `<preferred-ssh-port>` property will be exchanged with your actual SSH port.

:::

:::warning

If something is missing, retry to apply the above rules or have a look into the [firewall configuration](/docs/guides/system-setup/firewall-configuration.md) for further details.

:::

If you need to modify the firewall rules, such as removing an unwanted port rule, you can list them all.

```sh
sudo ufw status
```

:::info

To `delete` a specific port rule using `UFW`, type the `<rule-number>` that is no longer required.

:::

```sh
sudo ufw delete <rule-number>
```
