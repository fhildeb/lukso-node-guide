# 2.5 BIOS Setup

Proper BIOS configuration is critical for optimizing your node's energy consumption and overall performance. Adjusting the settings will ensure that your node machine runs smooth and efficient under various load scenarios and automatically restarts during power failures.

:::warning

BIOS settings vary depending on the CPU and motherboard. For further help, please refer to your deviceâ€™s documentation.

:::

## 1. Enter BIOS

1. Connect your machine to power and attach a keyboard and monitor.
1. Connect your bootable USB device to the node.
1. Turn on the node using the power button.
1. Press `F2` on your keyboard during boot to enter the BIOS setup.

## 2. Power Settings

:::info

Auto-starts enable your node to restart after a power interruption, reducing downtime and maintaining network participation.

:::

1. Navigate to `Power` -> `Secondary Power Settings`.
2. Set **After Power Failure** to `Power On`.
3. Set **Wake on LAN from S4/S5** to `Power On - Normal Boot`.

## 3. CPU Settings

:::info

These settings optimize performance on load and general energy efficiency. If your node has fans, skip the cooling adjustment.

:::

1. Go to `Cooling` and set **Fan Control Mode** to `Fanless` (for fanless housing).
2. Navigate to `Performance` -> `Processor`:
   - Set **Hyper-Threading** to `Enabled`.
   - Enable **Intel Turbo Boost Technology**.
   - Set **Active Processor Cores** to `All`.
   - Enable **Real-Time Performance Tuning**.
3. Navigate to `Power`:

   - Enable **Max Performance Enabled**.
   - Set **Intel Dynamic Power Technology** to `Energy Efficient Performance`.
   - Set **Package Power Limit 1 (Sustained)** to `25`.
   - Set **Package Power Limit 2 (Burst Mode)** to `25`.
   - Set **Package Power Time Window (Tau)** to `0`.

## 4. LED Settings

:::info

For server installations, you might choose to disable the illuminated status indicators.

:::

1. Go to `Power` -> `Secondary Power Settings`.
2. Set **S0 Indicator Brightness (%)** to `0`.
3. Set **Modern Standby Indicator Brightness (%)** to `0`.
4. In `RGB LED`, set **Brightness (%)** to `0`.
5. In `HDD LED`, set **Brightness (%)** to `0`.

## 5. Boot Order

:::info

Establishing the correct boot order ensures that your node boots from the correct device after it's USB installation.

:::

1. Go to `Boot` -> `Boot Priority`.
2. Set **Boot Option #1** to your USB device.
3. Set **Boot Option #2** to your internal SSD.

## 6. Startup

Once the BIOS settings are correctly configured, you can proceed with the operating system installation. Saving and exiting the BIOS applies your configuration changes, and booting the installation media initiates the operating system setup process.

1. Press `F10` to save changes and exit the BIOS.
2. Wait for the system to boot from the USB stick.
3. Choose `Try or Install Ubuntu Server`.
4. Allow the installation setup to run through.
