# 2.2 Mainboard Swap

This section will walk you through the process of installing the mainboard into a new fanless enclosure for passive cooling.

:::warning

Before you start building, ground yourself by touching a metal object, like a heater, to discharge any static electricity and prevent damage to sensitive technical components.

## Disassembling the Motherboard

**1. Open the Case**: _Remove the screws from the bottom of the NUC and gently open the case._

**3. Disconnect Cables**: _Disconnect all cables attached to the motherboard._

:::tip

Using a narrow wrench can improve your leverage when removing stubborn cables.

## Swapping the Enclosure

**1. Prepare the New Housing**: _Grab the new fanless housing, which also acts as a cooling block for the motherboard._

**6. Apply New Thermal Paste**: _Apply and spread a thin, even layer of thermal paste on the processor._

:::tip

A modest amount is sufficient. Excess paste may be pressed out and cause staining or uneven cooling.

**8. Gather Mounting Accessories**: _Identify and set aside the correct screws and spacers required for securing the motherboard._

![Swapping the Enclosure 8](/img/guides/hardware-setup/build_20.png)

**9. Install the Motherboard**: _Carefully insert the motherboard into the new housing and ensure no paste is smeared._
