# 2.4 OS Installation

<!-- TODO: Link to Theory/Preparations/Operation Systems-->

### 2.1.5 Validator Preparation

If you want to become a validator and have no other computer at home that can be flashed and used to safely generate your validator keys offline, head over to the [Key Generation](/validator-key-generation/) section and continue to use your node for it. After you receive your validator keys, you can continue with this guide, effectively flashing your machine again.

### 2.1.6 Ubuntu Download

After understanding operating system properties and considerations, download the official Ubuntu Server LTS version from `ubuntu.com/download/server`. You need a USB device with at least 2GB that you can use to install the firmware on the node's storage disk.

1. Download [Ubuntu 22.04.2 Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)
2. Create a Bootable USB Drive with the ISO file
   - Windows: [Rufus Guide for Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview)
   - Linux: [Disk Creator Guide for Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview)
   - MacOS: [Etcher Guide for Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#1-overview)
3. Disconnect the USB drive
4. Connect the USB drive to your node

### 2.1.7 Debian Download

After understanding the properties and considerations of the operating system, download the official Debian server version from `debian.org/distrib/`. You will require a USB device with a minimum of 2GB capacity to install the firmware on the node's storage disk.

1. Download [Debian 11 Bullseye](https://www.debian.org/distrib/)
2. Create a Bootable USB Drive with the ISO file as if you would do with Ubuntu.
   - Windows: [Rufus Guide for Debian](https://rufus.ie/)
   - Linux: [Ethcher Guide for Debian](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher)
   - MacOS: [Etcher Guide for Debian](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher)
3. Safely remove the USB drive
4. Connect the USB drive to your node
