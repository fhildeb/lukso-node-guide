# 1.2 OS Installation

This section covers the installation of the operating system for your offline machine used to generate the validator keys.

:::info

The guide uses the latest Ubuntu LTS release to ensure compatibility with the key generation tools and provides a stable, secure environment for generating your validator keys. Itâ€™s the quickest and easiest setup for an offline machine using a USB drive. However, you could also use MacOS or Windows.

## 1. Download and Preparation

Follow these steps to prepare your bootable USB device from a machine that connected to the internet:

**1. Download Ubuntu**: Get the latest official Ubuntu version from [Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

**2. Create a Bootable USB Drive**: Use the ISO file to create a bootable device:

- Windows: [Rufus Guide for Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview)
- Linux: [Disk Creator Guide for Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview)
- macOS [Etcher Guide for Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#1-overview)

**3. Finalize USB Preparation**:

- Disconnect the USB drive from your current computer.
- Reconnect the USB drive to your offline machine when ready.

## 2. System Installation

In this phase, Ubuntu will be installed on your offline machine. Keeping the system offline is crucial for ensuring the security and integrity of the key generation process as outlined in detail within the previous [Precautions](./precautions.md) page.
