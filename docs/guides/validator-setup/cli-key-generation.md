</Tabs>

## 3. Connect to Keygen Computer

:::info

The following steps are performed on your üóÑÔ∏è **offline computer**.

:::

1. Connect the prepared USB device to your computer.
2. Copy the archive file to your home directory.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to your home directory:

```sh
cd
```

## 4. Setup the Executable

:::info

The following steps are performed using Ubuntu. Commands may differ depending on the operating system.

:::

After downloading, we need to unpack the file. After downloading it, we can extract the tape archive using Ubuntu's archiving tool. We're going to extract (_x_) and compress (_z_) the tape archive into its previous packaged files (_f_) using verbose mode (_v_) to list all files being processed during the extraction and compression. Please note that the filenames might change due to the versioning.

**1. Unpack the downloaded file**

```sh
tar xzfv lukso-key-gen-cli-v2.5.8-linux.tar.gz
```

**2. Move into the created folder**

```sh
cd lukso-key-gen-cli-v2.5.8-linux
```

## 5. Generate Initial Keys

Follow these steps to generate your initial validator keys using the CLI tool:

**1. Start the Key Generation Process**: Start the tool using the _new-mnemonic_ option and paste your withdrawal address.

```sh
./lukso-key-gen new-mnemonic --eth1_withdrawal_address <your-withdrawal-address>
```

:::tip

When generating keys in multiple rounds, you can use the same withdrawal address multiple times so all revenue goes to the same account. Further details can be found on the [**Tokenomics**](/docs/theory/blockchain-knowledge/tokenomics.md) and [**Validator Credentials**](/docs/theory/node-operation/validator-credentials.md) pages within the üß† [**Theory**](/docs/theory/preparations/node-specifications.md) section.

:::

:::info

A **seed phrase** and a **mnemonic phrase** refer to the same thing: a human-readable set of words that encodes a cryptographic seed used to generate private keys. These terms are often used interchangeably depending on a more technical or more general context.

:::

:::note

The initial startup will take some time, do not close the terminal window.

:::

**2. Select the Language**: Choose your language by typing the corresponding number into the input prompt.

```text
> 3.
```

:::info

If you press _Enter_ it will select English as default.

:::

**3. Specify the Validator Number**: Select how many validator keys you want to generate to deposit stake.

```text
> 10
```

:::note

You can generate more keys than you immediately fund. These keys will remain inactive until they are sufficiently funded.

:::

:::info Split Deposits to multiple Wallets

If you only require deposits from a single wallet, simply complete the process once. However, if you have multiple wallets with varying amounts of LYXt, LYXe, or LYX to make the deposits with, you have two primary options:

**1. Generate Batches with the Same Seed**

- Generate keys for the first wallet using a new seed phrase.
- For subsequent wallets, import the existing mnemonic seed phrase and generate additional keys.
- This process produces separate `deposit_data.json` files for each wallet.

üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è _Example: 30 validators across 3 wallets, generated 10 keys per run in different files._

**2. Modify the Deposit File**

- Generate all keys in a single run, creating one comprehensive `deposit_data.json` file.
- Duplicate and modify the file and use a JSON Editor to remove `pubkey` entries, dividing keys appropriately.

üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è _Example: 30 validators across 3 wallets, generated 3 file copies and removed pubkey entries manually:_

- _Kept the first 10 `pubkey` entries for wallet one. (validators 1-10)_
- _Removed the first and last 10 `pubkey` entries for wallet two. (validators 11‚Äì20)_
- _Removed the first 20 `pubkey` elements for wallet three. (keeping validators 21‚Äì30)_

In both cases, you will have to go through the [**Launchpad Process**](./launchpad-walkthrough.md) 3 times, as the launchpad will check if your wallets have enough balance before you can continue to the deposit screen.

:::

**4. Select Network**: Choose between generating the _lukso-testnet_ or _lukso_ mainnet keys and press any key to continue.

```text
> lukso
```

**5. Password Input**: Input the password that will be used to encrypt your validator keys and confirm it.

**6. Mnemonic Seed Generation**: Your mnemonic seed phrase will be generated and printed in the terminal.

:::warning

Write down your mnemonic on paper and store it securely. Do not save it digitally as plain text. **Anyone with access** to this seed phrase **can control your deposits** or slash your validator, as it can be used to regenerate your validator's private keys and sign messages on your behalf. **Treat it like your most valuable secret.** Never share it or store it insecurely.

:::

**7. Confirm the Mnemonic**: You will be asked to re-enter your mnemonic seed phrase for verification purposes.

:::info

You have to input the words of your mnemonic seed phrase with spaces in between.

:::

When you press _Enter_, the CLI will check the seed. If correct, you will see the following output on the terminal window:

```text
                  #####     #####
                ##     #####     ##

**8. Reviewing Output Files**: The deposit files will be saved in the current destination, you can press any key to exit.

:::warning Verifying Generated Files

Please ensure that your destination folder contains a folder with the following files:

- `deposit_data.json`: This file is used to make deposit transactions during the [Deposit Launchpad](./launchpad-walkthrough.md) process.
- `keystore.json`: Each validator key has a corresponding keystore file, later used in the [Validator Setup](/docs/guides/client-setup/validator-configuration.md) process.

:::

## 6. Generate Additional Keys

If you need to add more stake, follow these steps to generate additional validator keys using the CLI tool:

**1. Navigate to the CLI Folder**: Ensure you are in the same folder as the LUKSO Key Gen CLI.

```sh
cd && cd lukso-key-gen-cli-v2.5.8-linux
```

**2. Rename Existing Folder**: To differentiate batches, rename the folder containing the first batch of keys.

```sh
mv validator_keys <new-folder-name>
```

**3. Run the Existing Mnemonic Process**: Start the tool using the _existing-mnemonic_ option and paste your withdrawal address.

:::tip

When generating keys in multiple rounds, you can use the same withdrawal address multiple times so all revenue goes to the same account. Further details can be found on the [**Tokenomics**](/docs/theory/blockchain-knowledge/tokenomics.md) and [**Validator Credentials**](/docs/theory/node-operation/validator-credentials.md) pages within the üß† [**Theory**](/docs/theory/preparations/node-specifications.md) section.

:::

```sh
./lukso-key-gen existing-mnemonic --eth1_withdrawal_address <your-withdrawal-address>
```

**4. Select the Language**: Choose your language by typing the corresponding number into the input prompt.

```text
> 3.
```

:::info

If you press _Enter_ it will select English as default.

:::

**5. Enter the Existing Mnemonic**: Input your previously generated mnemonic seed phrase when prompted.

**6. Specify the Validator Number**: Specify the amount of previous and new keys before verifying them again.

:::note

You can generate more keys than you immediately fund. These keys will remain inactive until they are sufficiently funded.

:::

:::tip

The starting index is the total amount of previously generated keys.

üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è _Example: If the starting index is 10, the tool will start generating the 11th deposit key._

:::

:::info

To regenerate keys for **a backup** or **updating** the **withdrawal address** or **password**, you can set the **starting index** to **0** and specify the total number of all your previously generated keys. The new files can then be re-used to setup a new node once the original one stopped operating.

:::

```text
> 10
```

**7. Select Network**: Choose between your network type and select _lukso-testnet_ or _lukso_ mainnet keys.

```text
> lukso
```

**8. Enter your Password**: Input the password that will be used to encrypt your validator keys and confirm it.

When you press _Enter_, the CLI will generate the validator keys, showing the following output on the terminal window:

```text
